<div class="wrapper"><h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1><p>My name is Maya Leitka and this year I am a senior here at UNM. My major is Sociology and I have two minors in Psychology and Professional Writing. After I graduate, I am hoping to enter the social work field and write and create media for local non-profit organizations here in New Mexico. Iâ€™ve taken UX classes that mention web design, but never got into specifics. Now and going into the future, basic web design will be an essential skill to have for any field, especially when dabbling in digital media.
  </p>
  <p>Throughout this course, we have learned many useful tools in website design. Not only have we practiced CSS and HTML skills when coding websites, but we've also explored design concepts that can be applied to many areas of digital design. With the tools I've learned in this class, I will be able to transfer them to all areas of design, especially document designwithin the field of Professional/Technical Writing. </p>
  <h2><u>Interests and Pet Sitting</u></h2><p>I currently work as a local dog walker and pet sitter. I love animals, and it's a great way to give back to my local Placitas community and work alongside both people and animals. This website will aim to combine both basic web design with demonstrating how pet sitting and dog walking have impacted my life and have even contributed to aspects of my interest in Sociology. </p>
  <p>In the navigation bar above, you will be able to visit other pages to this website to see my pet sitting portfolio and explanations of my services and overall take-away experiences from working with animals for the past four years. </p>
