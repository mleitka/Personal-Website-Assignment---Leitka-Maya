  <h1>Education - How Does Pet Sitting Meet Sociology?</h1>
  <p>I am currently majoring in Sociology at UNM. From the moment I discovered Sociology, I fell in love with it's theory and practice as a social science. I love looking at various aspects of our communities, societies, organizations and see how they all interact and intermingle with each other. </p>
  <p>I never would have guessed that I would have been pet sitting for so long before I moved to Placitas. It's a great example of how our communities, the places we live and the people we are around, shape our lives and our experiences. In Sociology, we talk about our social institutions, such as schools, neighborhoods, and work shaping the friends we meet, our values, and the skills we build and esteem. Without having moved to Placitas, I would have never met the wonderful people (and animals!) I know today.  </p>

  <h2><u>Likewise, How Does Pet Sitting Meet Web Design?</u></h2>
  <p>Another way that my pet sitting interacts with my education is through none other than web design. </p>
  <p>Reaching clients and networking is one of the most critical aspects of pet sitting. Through web design, pet sitters are able to create attractive portfolios that can attract more clients all in one centralized place. Geographical and demographical spread are all increased as well, as the website will be able to reach more people, even outside of the community you live in. </p>
  <p>This is a perfect way to also keep in touch and update new and returning clients with new policies, updates, or schedule changes. This website will be a perfect place to post photos and perhpas even client references. </p>
